  <h1>About me</h1>
  <h2 class="selectable">
    I make surprising, surreal artwork.  I express my personal life experiences by painting self-portraits.  Birds and other animals have fascinated me all my life and I use them in my paintings because they evoke intense emotions in me.  I hope you are intrigued by my paintings.  Please <a id="link-contact" href="#">contact me</a> if you would like to learn more about my artwork or if you are interested in commissioning custom work!
